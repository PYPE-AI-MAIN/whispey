# 🚀 Mock Data Setup - No Database Required!

Your voice analytics dashboard now runs entirely on **mock/dummy data** - perfect for demos with **zero setup required**!

## 🎯 What This Means

✅ **No Database Setup** - No Supabase, no Airtable, no external services  
✅ **No API Keys** - No credentials or tokens needed  
✅ **No Trials** - No time limits or payment required  
✅ **Instant Demo** - Works immediately after `npm run dev`  
✅ **Realistic Data** - Pre-loaded with professional demo data  
✅ **Full Functionality** - Create, read, update, delete operations work  

## 📊 Pre-loaded Demo Data

Your app comes with realistic dummy data:

### **Projects (3 demo projects)**
- 🏢 **Customer Support Hub** - AI-powered customer support agents
- 📞 **Sales Outreach Campaign** - Automated sales calling system  
- 🏥 **Healthcare Appointment Bot** - Medical appointment scheduling

### **Agents (4 demo agents)**
- 🤖 **Support Agent Alpha** - Inbound customer support
- 🤖 **Support Agent Beta** - Professional support agent
- 📈 **Sales Caller Pro** - Outbound sales agent
- 🏥 **Appointment Assistant** - Healthcare scheduling

### **Call Logs (Multiple demo calls)**
- Real conversation transcripts
- Various call outcomes (completed, failed, etc.)
- Realistic metrics (duration, costs, latency)
- Customer satisfaction scores

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **2. Set Up Environment (Optional)**
Create `.env.local` for Clerk authentication:
```env
# Clerk Authentication (required for login)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# No database variables needed!
```

### **3. Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **4. Open Your Browser**
Go to `http://localhost:3000` and enjoy your fully functional demo!

## 🎪 Demo Flow

1. **Login** with Clerk authentication
2. **View Projects** - See 3 pre-loaded demo projects
3. **Create New Project** - Add your own (stored in memory)
4. **Manage Agents** - View and create AI voice agents
5. **View Analytics** - See realistic call logs and metrics
6. **Full CRUD Operations** - Everything works like a real app!

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Mock Data Service (`src/lib/mockData.ts`)**
- **In-Memory Storage** - All data stored in JavaScript objects
- **Realistic Operations** - Full CRUD functionality
- **Data Persistence** - Data persists during session (resets on restart)
- **Professional Demo Data** - Carefully crafted realistic examples

### **API Routes Updated**
All API routes now use the mock data service:
- `/api/projects` - Project management
- `/api/agents` - Agent operations  
- `/api/user/projects` - User project access
- `/api/logs/call-logs` - Call analytics
- `/api/send-logs` - Log ingestion
- `/api/logs/test-connection` - Health checks

## 📈 Perfect for Demos

### **Client Presentations**
- Show professional interface with realistic data
- Demonstrate full functionality without setup time
- No internet connection required after initial load
- No risk of API failures during demos

### **Development & Testing**
- Instant development environment
- No database migration headaches
- Easy to modify demo data
- Perfect for UI/UX testing

### **Sales & Marketing**
- Impressive demo data that tells a story
- No signup friction for prospects
- Works on any device/environment
- Consistent demo experience

## 🎨 Customizing Demo Data

Want to customize the demo data? Edit `src/lib/mockData.ts`:

```typescript
// Add your own demo projects
this.projects = [
  {
    id: 'proj_custom',
    name: 'Your Custom Project',
    description: 'Your project description',
    // ... other fields
  }
  // ... existing projects
]
```

## 🔄 Data Persistence

### **During Session**
- ✅ Create new projects/agents - they persist until page refresh
- ✅ Edit existing data - changes remain active
- ✅ Full app functionality works normally

### **Between Sessions**
- ⚠️ Data resets to initial state on server restart
- ⚠️ New data doesn't persist permanently
- 💡 Perfect for clean demo environment every time
